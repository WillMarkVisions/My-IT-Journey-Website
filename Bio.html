                <h2>Welcome to My Journey</h2>
                <p class="quote">“Motivation gets you going, but discipline keeps you growing” - John C. Maxwell</p>
                <p>
                    My passion for technology began early in my career at AOL (America Online—I know, it sounds dated!). 
                    Working in the tech support center in Tampa, FL, I saw firsthand how technology could connect people and fuel personal growth. 
                    This passion only grew during my military service in the United States Air Force, where I had the opportunity to work on 
                    various aircraft, including KC-135s, F-16s, F-15s, and HH-60s, using Non-Destructive Testing technologies and Microsoft tools. 
                    These experiences were essential for effective communication and productivity, allowing me to adapt to diverse, 
                    high-pressure environments around the world. 
                </p>

                <p> 
                    My journey is filled with stories that have shaped who I am today.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, I see the perfect opportunity to merge my military-honed work ethic with my love for technology, 
                    aligning seamlessly with my commitment to continuous learning and growth.
