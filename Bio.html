                <p class="quote">“Motivation gets you going, but discipline keeps you growing” - John C. Maxwell</p>
                <p>
                    My passion for technology began during my early career at AOL's (America Online...I know I sound dated. LOL!)
                    tech support center in Tampa, FL, where I witnessed firsthand how technology can connect people and drive personal growth. 
                    This passion deepened during my military service, where leveraging Microsoft tools 
                    became essential for effective communication and productivity. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, I see the perfect opportunity to merge my military-honed work ethic with my love for technology, 
                    aligning seamlessly with my commitment to continuous learning and growth.
