            <h2>New Opportunities Equals New Growth</h2>
            <p>
                I'm here to collaborate, contribute, and learn from the vibrant technology community. As I embark on this exciting transition,
                I am eager to connect with fellow IT professionals, share insights, and actively participate in projects that align with my skill set and aspirations.
            </p>

            <h2>Eager to Leverage Hands-on Lab Experience and Continuous Self-Study</h2>
            <p>
                I have built a custom home lab environment running Windows Server 2022, where I have configured 
                essential services like Active Directory, DNS, and DHCP. Utilizing VMware Workstation Pro and 
                Microsoft Hyper-V for virtualization, this lab allows me to deepen my understanding of 
                server management and network services, continuously expanding my skills through practical, 
                real-world scenarios.
            </p>

            <p>
                This is my first website so more updates to come soon!
